# ðŸš€ Day 2/30:  Python Variables & Data Types

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered
- Integer, Float, String, and Boolean data types
- Variable declaration and usage
- Type conversion (str â†” int/float)
- Basics of user input with input()
- Real-world logic with simple arithmetic

## ðŸ’» Challenge
- Task: Write a Python program that calculates the area of a rectangle using user-input values for length and width.

```python
# Get User input for length and width

length=float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
width=float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))

# calculate the Area
area= length* width

# Display the Area
print(f"The area of the rectangle is:  {area} square units")
```

## ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings
- Using input() allows us to make our programs interactive.
- float() is used for type conversion since input() returns a string.
- Variables store reusable values and help build logic step-by-step.
- Understanding data types is essential for writing bug-free code.


# Todayâ€™s challenge wasnâ€™t just about calculating area â€” itâ€™s about understanding how to make Python interact with real-world data, and how different types (text, numbers, decimals, true/false) play roles in every program we write.
