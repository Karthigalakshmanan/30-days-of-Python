# ðŸš€ 30 Days of Python

This repository documents my journey through the **30 Days of Python Challenge** organized by the **Indian Data Club**.

Each folder contains:
- A daily challenge (`challenge.py`)
- Notes on what I learned (`README.md`)

## ðŸ“… Daily Progress

## âœ¨ Motivation

This challenge is about **learning**, **consistency**, and **growth**. I hope it helps others too!
